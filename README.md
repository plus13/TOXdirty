# TOXdirty
playing with PyTox bindings and try to make it down to C.

You maybe need to install PyTox via "pip install pytox".

Start the echoexp.py in examples. Start it with "python echoexp.py echo.dat" to preserve TOX_ID. Don't use mine which I'm using right now please.

I added the echo_bot.c It does work to 85%. I have problems with the system filewriting and reading in C.
